# jsHintsAndTrips
Just a simple collection of javascript and node.js related hints and trip-ups

Then consider the alternate implementations in *aha.js,* and observe things happening in a more predictable fashion.

Note: there may be / are likely better design patterns available for the same purpose. These are provided as 'one way to do it'...
